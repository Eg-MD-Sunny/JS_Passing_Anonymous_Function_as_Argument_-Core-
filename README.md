### </> JS_Passing_Anonymous_Function_as_Argument_[Core]

### </> Description: </br>

The function is a set of instructions that is executed whenever it is called and returns some result as its answer. Functions are created by using a particular syntax, for example in JavaScript you use the function keyword and then the function name and then parenthesis. Similarly, the Anonymous functions are the same but the difference is in the syntax.</br>
JavaScript Anonymous function does not have a name with its declaration and this is usually passed as the argument to the other higher-order functions. The anonymous function is basically built and used for instant function execution within a function as a parameter.</br>

When anonymous functions are constructed, they can be assigned to variables, giving you the same capabilities as if you used a name in the function declaration.</br>
